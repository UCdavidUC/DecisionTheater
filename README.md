Decision Theater: Programming Languages Project

Because it improves communication and information exchange between people, multimedia information becomes extensively used for applications such as entertainment, medicine, advertising and education. A multimedia information system (MIS) encompassses representation ,storage, retrieval, process, transmition and representation, storage, retrieval, process, transmition and presentation of several time independan (eg. video or audio) and time challenge and many problems such as managing presentations including several types of data composed and synchronized in different manners is the focus of this project.

To be able to achieve this project, you consider the following phases:

## Phase 1

Read the paper uploaded in Blackboard 10% (Delivered).

## Phase 2

Language specification for multimedia presentation composition. You must consider: a. Creation of individual multimedia objects with two aspects: i. Temporal aspects.: delay and duration ii. Spatial aspects: Screen, x-coord, y-coord b. Parallel composition of two or several objects. c. Serial composition of two or several objects. The tool thata we will use is ANTLR 20% (Delivered)

## Phase 3

Creation of Java classes that represent each type of mutimedia object 15% (Delivered)

## Phase 4

Creation of instance object examples of the language (Phase 2) using the classes in phase 3 5% (Delivered)

## Phase 5

Creation of the multimedia execution machine using Drools and execution of different multimedia presentations 20% (Pending)

## Phase 6

Final presentation of your project using your own tool 15% (Pending)

## Phase 7

Final report and documentation 15% (Pending)


# Start working with
First clone this repo locally, open Eclipse and create new Drools Project because we will be working with Drools that will be integrated
our Java based project and its classes.
